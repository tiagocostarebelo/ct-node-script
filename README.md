***NODEJS Script***

Create a node script which, when executed, reads from the reddit endpoint https://www.reddit.com/r/aww.json and lists out all the post titles to the command line, Each on a new line. It should also output the urls to a text file named 'url_list.log'.


**INSTALATION and RUNNING SCRIPT**

- Clone or Download the files
- Open the folder in your Code Editor of preference
- cd over to the respective folder in your terminal
- use npm to install the dependencies and devDependencies required and start the server
```
npm i
npm run start
```

- The magic happens in the terminal and in your folder. Enjoy.

***NOTE***
Uncomment the first block of Code and comment the second block of code, if you want to try the script without using Axios, just using Node and HTTP.
Do the opposite and comment the first block of code and uncomment the second block of code in order to use Node and Axios.
